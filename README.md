# flutter_worldtime_app

This was the first flutter application I created, it was a chance for me to both use flutter and get a sense of mobile app development.

## Development

I developed this application in Android Studio. The majority of the work was done inside the lib folder, the resource folder I created to store image and font assets. 
The pubspec.yaml file was used to manage resources and dependencies.

I used the API https://timeapi.io/api to get the data on the various timezones.
